@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .left-column, .right-column {
        flex-basis: 100%; /* Each column takes full width on smaller screens */
    }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .gallery figure {
        flex-basis: calc(50% - 10px);
    }
}

@media (max-width: 365px) {
    nav ul li {
        display: block;
        margin-bottom: 10px;

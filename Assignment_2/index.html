            <h2>My Professional Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Full Stack Developer with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and a current Master of Science in Information Systems candidate at Northeastern University. My professional journey has been marked by a deep passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning.

                This passion extends across various domains, with a specific focus on Data Science and Web Development. I've demonstrated this commitment through the successful completion of multiple online courses and certifications in Python & Data Science.

                My professional experience includes a significant role at C2L Biz Solutions, a leading IT service provider. Here, I played a crucial part in the insurance domain, collaborating with a dynamic team to develop web applications. Using Java, Oracle SQL, JSP, HTML5, and CSS, I contributed to delivering high-quality solutions that met client expectations.

                Proficient in Java, Oracle SQL, JSP, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, I have effectively enhanced user interfaces and functionalities in web applications.

                Looking ahead, my goal is to secure a summer internship in 2024 in the USA, where I aim to contribute to industry growth and innovation with my skills and expertise. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am eager to be a part of the future of technology.
